*Breaking*

- Changed modelChange behaviour binding method from behaviour.path only to behaviour.watch + .path. This allows the behaviour to watch multiple paths, and fixes a bug where all modelChange paths needed to be absolute.
- Change modelChange behaviour to fire only if the model change event returns a truthy value. This allows greater control over when the change actions should be run.

*Blackbox*

- Changed how _gaffaKeys_ are passed when evaluating an expression that uses filter or slice. the _gaffaKeys_ property is now on the resultant array. This fixes a bug where if you passed the result of a filter or slice through another function, the keys would be lost.

- Changed how lists clone templates to JSON.stringify(JSON.parse()) for speed.

*New*

- Exposed deDom. Changed how it counts decendants to use querySelectorAll so now the function actually works.
